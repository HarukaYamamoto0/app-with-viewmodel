This is just a study project I developed to explore and learn how to use `ViewModel` with `Jetpack Compose`. This app serves as a practical example of how to manage UI state and handle component lifecycle in the modern Android environment.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Kotlin**: Main development language.
- **Jetpack Compose**: Declarative UI framework for Android.
- **ViewModel**: Android Jetpack component for state management.
- **StateFlow**: Tool for managing reactive data.

## 🔧 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/HarukaYamamoto0/app-with-viewmodel.git
    ```
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Build and run the app on an emulator or physical device.

## 📚 What I Learned

- How to use `ViewModel` to separate business logic from UI logic.
- The importance of correctly managing component lifecycle using `ViewModel`.
- How to integrate `StateFlow` to create reactive and updatable UIs.
